# Iodine
A simple web interface for the [USDA Iodine database](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-bhnrc/beltsville-human-nutrition-research-center/methods-and-application-of-food-composition-laboratory/mafcl-site-pages/iodine/)

## Installation
First, get a copy of the iodine database as a CSV. Create a database and put that information into `config.json`. Then run `npm run load file.csv` to load the database.
Then, run the site with `npm start` (or some other method of running `server.js`).
